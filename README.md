# Prediction-Model-for-College-Rankings

The purpose of this study is to create a prediction model for college ranking with variables that
are perceived to be important in student admission. Different prediction models were constructed to
compare their accuracy of prediction. We realized that variables SAT and ACT scores, tuition and
admission all demonstrated a linear relationship with college rankings. Clustering was performed to verify
if the colleges could be clustered by a certain variable and supervised learning procedures were
undertaken for cross-validation and verification of the modelâ€™s external validity. The results of this study
shows that rankings could be most accurately predicted with the multiple-regression model that includes
variables average SAT scores, tuition, and admission rate. The model demonstrated better out of sample
performance upon the application of a GAM model.
